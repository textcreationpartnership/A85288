            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>YOu may (out of common ſenſe) ſuppoſe what a ſad condition we are in here, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way encompaſſed with dangers; and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not look over one gulph, before we ſee our ſelves ſurprized with another.</p>
            <p>If there be any Inhabitant here that refuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to comply with the Petition of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he is invironed with the ſcorn of all his Neighbours.</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:161753:3"/>
            <p> And thoſe who doe joyne with them for defence thereof, they are in danger of the cenſure of the Parliament, and laſh of the Army.</p>
            <p>The deſires of the Country are, to Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Parliament, that the King may come to London, and that they will treat with His Majeſty, that both Kingdomes may be ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in peace; Money be raiſed to pay the Souldiery, and the Army to be disbanded. This is the ſumme of their Petition, which they ſo ſtrive to ſend to the Parliament.</p>
            <p>There are divers perſons of conſiderable quality that joyne in theſe deſires: Some Lords, nigh 20 Knights, Gentlemen, Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders, Farmers, and other Inhabitants in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance. And many Seamen comply alſo.</p>
            <p>The intent was to have met together at Black-Heath yeſter day, And there to have drawn themſelves into Brigades, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe as ſhould have beene concluded at Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter the night before, where they thought to have left a ſufficient ſtrength,</p>
            <p>Many, came to Rocheſter that night from Canterbury, and other parts further in Kent,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:161753:3"/>And the Towne was very full, their reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions being to march the next morning as aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>But they had advertiſements that night, that the Lord Generall was in his march to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them with divers Regiaments, intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to fall upon them that night, the Army being much inraged againſt them.</p>
            <p>Hereupon the Gentlemen that manage the buſineſſe conſulted what to doe, and finding it not ſafe to march, leaſt the Army ſhould deſtroy them, as they ſuppoſed they might if they ſhould fall upon them, They reſolved not to march to Black-Heath, as they thought to have done.</p>
            <p>And whereas they thought this day to have ſent their Petition to the Parliament by 20 Gentlemen choſen for that purpoſe, And the body to have ſtaied at Black-Heath: they upon hearing of the Armies drawing thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther declined it, and reſolved firſt to ſend to deſire leave for ſuch Gentlemen as they ſhould ſend, to paſſe to and fro, in ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>Here are many come to joyne with this
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:161753:4"/>County in their Petition, both from Surry, Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex and other parts, many come daily from London, the number increaſeth to many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, ſo that they are more troubled for Armes and Proviſion then men.</p>
            <p>Some Inhabitants have complained to the Gentlemen that they have had their goods taken from them, whereupon Proclamation hath been made, that none preſume to plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or take away any thing from any man, Magazeenes and Armes being the cheifeſt things they take now: But I doe not ſee how they can ſubſiſt ſo long.</p>
            <p>I pray God that ſome way may be found out, that there may not be that great blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed and ſlaughter which is ſo much feared.</p>
            <p>Do but conſider what muſt of neceſſity follow if one party kill and deſtroy the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to a conqueſt in blood, If the Army prevaile, will they not (thinke you) bee as high as ever, and inrage not only this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but many more. And on the other ſide if they defeate the Army, how then will the Parliament and the City of London be tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled on, and all authority ſlighted and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:161753:4"/>no better event can be expected to follow if this quarrell be ended in blood, which God forbid.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>AFter a ſpeedy march we arrived here ſafe and ſhall ſtoppe all diſturbances to the Parliament this day.</p>
            <p>The Kentiſh men have ſome knowledge of our comming to this place, ſo that they march not hither to day. Yet there are very full about Rocheſter.</p>
            <p>Things go on very well about Dover, ſo that thoſe Forces will be ready (I ſuppoſe) to our aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>There were ſome Country men comming this way, who ſeeing us upon the heath, came towards Shouters-Hill, we diſcovered them, and ambuſcadoed the way; not knowing but they had been a Forlorn, to ſome Body
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:161753:5"/>approaching (but it ſeemes it was onely a miſtake in them.)</p>
            <p>We marched up to them to ſeize on them as priſoners: but one of them ſhot one of our Troopers, who is dead, as gallant a ſtout man as any is in the whole Army.</p>
            <p>Wee neither killed nor wounded any of them, but took about 30 priſoners, And them the Souldiers changed cloathes with, and brought them away bound with matches.</p>
            <p>Some Gentlemen have been taken on both ſides, of whom there have bin ſome exchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. His Excellency the Lord Generall, is ſending to them, to offer them, that if they will lay down their Arms and go home, their Petition ſhall be preſented to the Parliament, and that his Excellency will mediate to the Parliament for them.</p>
            <p>We have received Letters from Wales, that Collo. Herbert hath taken Chepſtow Caſtle in Wales, Sir Nicholas Kemiſh and his Lieutenant ſlain, many wounded, and all the men pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners at mercy. There were in the Caſtle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 20 piece of Ordnance, 30 barrels of gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder, and above 1000 Armes</p>
